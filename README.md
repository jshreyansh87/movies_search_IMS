# Movies Search IMS

## Introduction
This is a simple and small project to search information related to movies that has been added in the database. The information displayed for each movie include its rating on IMDB and rotten tomatoes, synopsis, cast, songs, box office info, etc.

This project is a part of my submission for the course IMS in 3rd semester where we were required to do a really small project and display our understanding of different kind of SQL queries.

## Aim of the Project
This project was aimed to get a better understanding of different SQL queries, and to further enhance my knowledge of using MySQL. My general thought process while doing this project was that understanding different concepts while working on a small project can be a lot more effective.

## Let's see what we have here
1. The first page or the homepage of this website welcomes the user with an image carousel which contains three of the top rated movies in the database. We also have a list of some genre specified movies below like action, comedy, sci-fi.

2. Next we have the movies tab that contains a list of all the available movies in the database.

3. We also have a find tab where we can sort movies according to ratings in different order, or search for specific type of movies like Bollywood, Hollywood. This tab contains basic SQL search, order, limit queries to order the available movies in different orders.

4. The navigation bar of the website also contains a search bar where we query a particular name and find if that particular movie is present on the database or not. It contains the SQL query to search the movies in a database.
